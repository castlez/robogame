AI for a robot game.

Explanation: The project is a collaborative effort to build an AI for a game involving robots. Our intent is to individually develop AIs and compete against one another in order to produce the most effective strategies. When we have an effective AI, we can upload it and test our code against AI that other people wrote.

Developers: Jonny Castle and Patrick Douglas
