All my brainstorming thoughts:

ALGORITHM:
-check if in spawn zone. 
   if yes, find open space and go there.
   if no, continue

-check surrounding area.
    if 1 enemy:
      if myhealth > enemyhealth:
        attack
      if myhealth < enemyhealth:
         if they have less than 15, suicide
         else back away
    if 2 or more enemy:
      if both less than 15 and mine less than 20, suicide
      else back away
    else go to move

-move to center:
  if cant go further, guard
